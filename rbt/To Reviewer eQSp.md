Thank you for your useful comments and suggestions on our manuscript. They are very valuable and helpful for revising and improving the paper. We have studied the comments carefully and made revision accordingly. The detailed responds are listed as follows:

**【Q1】** What happens  when a mobile device is acting as a hotspot for other devices? Would Magnifier be able to detect those as well?

**【A1】** When a mobile device operates as a hotspot for other devices, Magnifier can identify the access of those devices, provided that the hotspot device has already joined the internal network. This capability stems from the hotspot device functioning as a wireless router or a "bridge," facilitating the connection of other devices to the same internal network. Consequently, mobile devices involved in this network configuration establish connections with servers beyond the domain. The detection of network access behaviors of these mobile devices becomes feasible when the traffic between mobile devices and servers is captured at the gateway.

​	To validate this assertion, we conducted additional experiments with specific settings. Initially, a Huawei P30 and a Huawei P50 were integrated into the internal network, both of which had their hotspots enabled. It is worth noting that not all mobile devices support the simultaneous activation of the WLAN module and hotspot module; for instance, Huawei devices can, while Vivo devices cannot. Subsequently, other devices joined the network through these hotspots. Magnifier was deployed on the gateway to scrutinize the network access patterns of these connected devices. The results of the experiments are outlined below:

|                    | DR (Brand-Level) | FAR (Brand-Level) | DR (Model-Level) | FAR (Model-Level) |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Magnifier (Origin) | 97.54%           | 0.25%             | 96.83%           | 0.25%             |
| Magnifier (Bridge) | 97.49%           | 0.24%             | 96.92%           | 0.24%             |

​	The hyperparameters of Magnifier (Bridge) are identical to those of Magnifier (Origin). As illustrated, Magnifier successfully identifies network access when a mobile device serves as a hotspot for other devices.



**【Q2】** Need to  compare against commercial solutions that are used by enterprise networks to detect the mobile devices and their brands.

**【A2】** Commercial solutions employed by enterprises predominantly center around monitoring the network access of laptops or desktops, primarily utilizing endpoint-based methods. However, as highlighted in the paper, there is a notable scarcity of solutions claiming the capability to detect the network access of mobile devices, primarily due to the limitations inherent in such methods. 

​	For instance, Sangfor serves as an illustrative example. It provides a comprehensive Network Behavior Management (NBM) solution within the commercial domain. This solution is designed to fulfill various functions, including endpoint security and access control. Operating on a centralized server architecture, Sangfor's NBM solution offers access authentication services. However, certified devices can enable hotspot functionality, allowing unauthorized devices to access the intranet. As a result, the capabilities of this commercial solution, such as Cisco ISE, FortiNAC, and Ivanti NAC, are restricted.

​	The inclusion of commercial solutions in our paper's discussion is a valuable addition. Moreover, we have augmented our experiments with additional baselines, specifically concentrating on IoT device recognition and encrypted traffic classification.

​	Sivanathan et al. [1] introduced a machine learning framework for the classification of IoT devices. This classification method involved analyzing various traffic features, including activity cycles, signaling patterns, communication protocols, and cipher suites.

​	ProfilIoT [2] represents a machine learning-driven approach designed for the identification of IoT devices within a network. The primary goal is to discern whether a given traffic flow originates from a PC, a smartphone, or a specific IoT device. The methodology involves the deployment of a set of classifiers, utilizing machine learning algorithms in a multi-stage process. This process enables the classification of traffic flows generated by a particular device based on their respective IP addresses.

​	ET-BERT  [3] is one of the state-of-the-art solutions on encrypted traffic classification. It considers the raw byte of the traffic sessions as the input of the pre-trained BERT. ET-BERT designs two novel pre-training tasks for traffic classification.

​	TFE-GNN [4] is one of the state-of-the-art solutions on encrypted traffic classification. It proposes a byte-level traffic graph construction approach based on point-wise mutual information (PMI).

​	We assessed the supplementary baselines under the identical settings outlined in the paper, specifically conducting the classification within the established detection duration of 15 seconds. The experimental results are as follows: 

|                | DR (Brand-Level) | FAR (Brand-Level) | DR (Model-Level) | FAR (Model-Level) |

**【Q3】** You need to add a detailed implementation section with technical details on how Magnifier is implemented.

**【A3】** Before deployment, the initialization of Magnifier involves the meticulous construction and distillation of fingerprints, as elaborated in Section 4. This process ensures the creation of well-defined fingerprints that form the basis for Magnifier's functionality. Subsequently, Magnifier has been effectively deployed in real-world scenarios. Specifically, it is employed for the detection of network access by mobile devices in both campus networks and production networks. The implementation is outlined as follows:

1. Magnifier is strategically deployed on both the gateway of our campus network and the enterprise network gateway. The implementation utilizes the KAFKA and Protobuf framework, supported by the DPDK backend.
2. Initially, a probe, developed using DPDK, is employed to capture passing traffic at the gateway. Upon capturing DNS traffic, the subsequent network traffic within a 15-second timeframe from the identified IP is collected and stored in the cache. 
3. Subsequently, a feature extractor is utilized to consistently extract domain features from the cached traffic fragments. These extracted features are represented as "Dn-freq" pairs (e.g., {dn_1: n_1, dn_2: n_2,..., dn_k: n_k }) and encapsulated within a protobuf message. The KAFKA producer then pushes this message to a predefined topic. It's important to note that the processed traffic is promptly flushed from the cache.
4. The real-time detection algorithm is integrated into a Docker environment, allowing for efficient resource allocation by adjusting the number of detector instances. These instances continually retrieve protobuf messages from the subscribed topic. The algorithm utilizes well-designed fingerprints to detect behaviors and outputs results, including the determination of network access and identification of the device's brand/model.



**【Q4】** not sure of the relevance to WebConf

**【A4】** Our research is centered on enhancing efficient network monitoring and topology measurement by pinpointing unauthorized network access and collecting in-depth information about mobile devices. This aligns with the pivotal role of network or web management, characterized by the skillful acquisition of information within authorized networking domains. Our work falls within the scope of the track categorized as "traffic analysis." Additionally, we are pleased to note that papers addressing similar topics have had a profound impact on the WebConf community [1] [2] [3].
